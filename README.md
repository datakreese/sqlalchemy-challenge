# sqlalchemy-challenge
# This was a very difficult assignment for me. There are two tutoring sessions and two office hour sessions invested here, along with countless youtube videos, documentation reviews, and Xpert inquiries. 

# In the climate analysis:
# The first graph may look exaclty like the answer key because both the professor and I could not find a successful method to dynamically calculate the previous year based on the variety of imported libraries. I put in 6 hours of debugging before we spent 45 minutes on it together.
# The final histogram of the climate analysis also turned out really complex because I didn't know the bins could be created within the plot details. I also wasn't aware that the histogram would automatically count the items within each bin. I spent about 4 hours distinctly binning, merging, and counting the data without successfully being able to graph everything. Ultimately my professor trimmed 20 lines of code down to 6 and we had our results.

# The flask section went a little smoother. 
# The code used to jsonify lists and tuples was copied from in class activities.
# The tutor Hassan Mehmood helped explain the instructions for the dynamic query and guided me through each version.
